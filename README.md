## 💡 Inspiration

We created Kyra to answer a growing question:
**"Why isn’t there an easier way to prototype and share GPT-powered assistants?"**

Bolt.new allowed us to rapidly bring this vision to life — building full-stack functionality in a no-code AI-native environment. Our goal is to democratize the creation of intelligent agents, no code or auth required.
